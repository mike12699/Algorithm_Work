### Hi there! :wave:

My name is Michael Nadasky. I am from Chicago, Illinois and currently having a focus on game programming. I have roughly 3 years of experience and am willing to learn a lot more in the future. I have good experience with the C# language and have made some projects in that language.

For this Algorithms class, I will have the following categories for any upcoming projects:

1. Week 1
   1. Class Work
   2. Practice
   3. Homework
   4. Side Projects

This is an example of how I would like to organize my work in the coming weeks. This will help me because I can easily access my work and continue to practice any topics. I will come back to edit this if changes need to take place. This is a rough breakdown of what I would like to do.
