### Data Structures Sample

In this project, it includes the methods for an array, a dictionary, stacks, and queues. Both the array and dictionary methods call over a class called "Users". This class includes the description for each user such as their ID number, first name, and last name. For the stacks and queues, both have their own methods to call in the variables. The stack method would call in the variables "a" and "b" while the queue method would call in the variables "1" and "2".
