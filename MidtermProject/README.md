###Alien Invaders Update Midterm

For the past couple weeks, I was able to separate the classes so that reading the code would be much easier. The projectile class and alien class now have their own set of code which can be called over. In addition to these changes, I made sure the timer does not keep rolling over when the game over and win screen are displayed. Instead of creating a new level when a player wins the game, I changed up some of the code so that the difficulty increases when there are a certain number of enemies on screen. Since I couldn't implement another level, I can look over this project more and figure out how I would be able to do that. For some quality of life updates, I could attempt on implementing some sound in game so that it isn't just dead silence. Although I changed up my goal to something I was able to touch up on, I will say that I am overall satisfied with the final result. Everything works out the way I imagined it to and doesn't cause any fatal errors. I'll look into MonoGame more so that I can learn new material and apply this to the projects and future MonoGame projects down the line.
