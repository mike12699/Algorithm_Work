### Algorithm Searching

In this project, I used my knowledge to create three simple search methods that include a linear, binary, and interpolation search. Linear searching gave me the opportunity to work out with the best case and worst case scenario of the outcome. Binary search let me experience creating a sorted array with a specific amount of integers. It would search for an indexed number located in the array. Interpolation search let me experience how it would search for the correct value near the element. In this case, it should search near the highest or lowest index.
