###Alien Invaders Update

For this week, I was able to separate the classes so that reading the code would be muh easier. The projectile class and alien class now have their own set of code which can be called over. My next task is to implement a boolean to fix the timer from continuing after the player beats the level. I will also try and implement one additional level so that there is more engagement. Overall, I am satisfied with where this is heading. The game works just as I expected without any fatal errors.
