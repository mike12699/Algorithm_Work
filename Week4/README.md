### Alien Invaders

This is a mock up of the game _Space Invaders_. I created this project to pay homage to the game and test my skills on how to make the enemies move around. Here I made the enemies in rows and columns, and they move back and forth. The player must shoot all of the enemies to claim victory. If the player gets hit once, it's game over. Players can keep playing to have a faster time as their high score. I will try and attempt to come back to this project to make some quality of life changes so that the code is more reasonable to understand.
