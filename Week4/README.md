### Alien Invaders

This is a mock up of the game _Space Invaders_. I created this project in Game Programming I as a part of my final project. Here I made the enemies in rows and columns, and they move back and forth. The player must shoot all of the enemies to claim victory. If the player gets hit once, it's game over. Players can keep playing to have a faster time as their high score.
